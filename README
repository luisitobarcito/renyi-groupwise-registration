This code reproduces all experimental results in the paper 
"Group-wise point-set registration based on Renyi's second order entropy"

Before running the main routine in ./examples/all_experiments.m, Download
    T. Chen's  code for group-wise point-set registration using CDF Havrda-Charv√°t Divergence
    This can be done by executing ./lib/external/download_cdfHC.sh

To run the faces demo in ./exmaples/run_face_demo.h
download the face data by running the script
    ./data/download_face_data.sh
